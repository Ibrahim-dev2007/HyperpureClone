# 🥗 Hyperpure Clone – Promptify Web Designing Competition

This project is a **point-to-point clone** of [Hyperpure by Zomato](https://www.hyperpure.com/), built under time constraints during the **Promptify – Web Designing Competition** at *Quanta Verse 2025*, hosted by **M.S. Ramaiah College of Arts, Science & Commerce (Autonomous), Bengaluru**.

I represented **Nrupathunga University** in this event.
